NOTE: reset may only be required when using jasmine. Not sure.


* With the Jasmine adapter, one has to run all tests in the matched test files
* Even if Jasmine were filtering out which tests to run, still all tests files are loaded first,
  which means all dependencies get preloaded anyway
* Test coverage will probably only work if we put the sources in the "load" config section, which
  means all will be pre-loaded
* Test coverage might use a different source loader which would take some tweaking of our AMD plugin,
  or we could just set async: false
* In order to load something without the "/test/" context path via the "load:" section of the config,
  one must use the full URL (ex: http://localhost:9876/website-static/src/dojo/dojo.js). Just
  staring with "/" doesn't work.
* you can't set up a matcher for "/static/*". "/static/" seems to be used by JsTestDriver
* The default basePath is the location of jsTestDriver.conf.
* If you try to put a CSS file in the "load:" config section, it will work the first time, but you
  will have to reset the server before running it again. I believe it tries to add the css include
  again and then wait for an onload that never comes because it was already loaded or something like
  that.
